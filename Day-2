Approach and lessons:

Figuring out that the blue bird meant twitter was easy but I researched a bit further to make sure I was going in the right direction. Then I used ChatGPT to understand how tweet IDs work. First I tried to Dcode the provided hex. Then when I directly put in the 40 byte code into chatGPT it gave me random possibilities of what it could be other than what it is. I initially missed the line where SOLIDITY and CALCULATOR were mentioned. Then I researched about solidity and asked chatGPT how this hex was related to cryptocurrency. I wasted a lot of time searching it directly on etherscan. The hint lies in there being no space in goearly. When I put in the exact post into GPT and emphasized on goearly, it recognized it as Goerli. This platform allows transactions with ETH(fake cryptocurrency) to test contracts. Then I found the source code of the contract and decompiled it. The only part of the code that is not properly decompiled and hard to understand is this:

const unknown53e98b64 = 32, 51, 0xfe57656c636f6d6520746f207468652063616c63756c61746f722e205965732c206974206973206d616465206279206d65203a, mem


When I put this into GPT, it said that it was a function identifier. (Had to take Raghav bhaiya's help to figure out about Ethereum signature database, pull request if you have a reason to go in that direction). Then I put in the first 4 bytes to get the text signature which was luckily the author's name. This had to be run on sherlock to find his tweet on insta(I wish I could go way back in time which kinda indicates COMMITS). Then I found the account on GitHub with slight change in name(FlaireVoucher69). The previous commit had to be analyzed only on Ubuntu using the git log command as the e-mail is not displayed in GitHub directly. This is the first part of the flag. If you carefully notice, there is text in the banner of Melon&Rusk's twitter account. When I put this into Dcode, it was suggested that it was either a youtube or Instagram link. It was youtube and then I found the channel. YOUTUBE BANNERS ARE NOT FULLY DISPLAYED. I used a website to download the full image of the banner of that channel which had the second part of the flag.
