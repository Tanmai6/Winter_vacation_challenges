I put the file into wireshark first. Then I tried exporting packets from 2 onwards but I always got it with time/serial numbers and ascii form along with it.
So I had to use Tshark and chatgpt to get the hexadecimal form of the hole code. And then I used xxd command to convert this file into ascii and .jpg format.
Then flag is clearly visible in it. NOTE: It is important to display filter ICMP only otherwise the ethernet and IPV4 part also comes in.
